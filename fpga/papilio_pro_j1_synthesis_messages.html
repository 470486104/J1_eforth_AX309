<tr><td>WARNING&nbsp;</td><td>Xst:647 - Input &lt;io_din&lt;15:8&gt;&gt; is never used. This port will be preserved and left unconnected if it belongs to a top-level block or it belongs to a sub-block and the hierarchy of this sub-block is preserved.</td><td>New</td></tr>
<tr><td>WARNING&nbsp;</td><td>Xst:3002 - This design contains one or more registers/latches that are directly
incompatible with the Spartan6 architecture. The two primary causes of this is
either a register or latch described with both an asynchronous set and
asynchronous reset, or a register or latch described with an asynchronous
set or reset which however has an initialization value of the opposite 
polarity (i.e. asynchronous reset with an initialization value of 1).
 While this circuit can be built, it creates a sub-optimal implementation
in terms of area, power and performance. For a more optimal implementation
Xilinx highly recommends one of the following:
       1) Remove either the set or reset from all registers and latches
          if not needed for required functionality
       2) Modif...

<tr><td>WARNING&nbsp;</td><td>Xst:1426 - The value init of the FF/Latch uart_inst/Uart_Rxrate/counter.Cnt_7_LD hinder the constant cleaning in the block papilio_pro_j1.
You should achieve better results by setting this init to 1.</td><td>New</td></tr>
<tr><td>INFO&nbsp;</td><td>Xst:1767 - HDL ADVISOR - Resource sharing has identified that some arithmetic operations in this design can share the same physical resources for reduced device utilization. For improved clock frequency you may try to disable resource sharing.</td><td>New</td></tr>
<tr><td>INFO&nbsp;</td><td>Xst:3226 - The RAM &lt;Mram_ram&gt; will be implemented as a BLOCK RAM, absorbing the following register(s):</td><td>New</td></tr>
<tr><td>INFO&nbsp;</td><td>Xst:3231 - The small RAM &lt;Mram_rstack&gt; will be implemented on LUTs in order to maximize performance and save block RAM resources. If you want to force its implementation on block, use option/constraint ram_style.</td><td>New</td></tr>
<tr><td>INFO&nbsp;</td><td>Xst:3218 - HDL ADVISOR - The RAM &lt;Mram_dstack&gt; will be implemented on LUTs either because you have described an asynchronous read or because of currently unsupported block RAM features. If you have described an asynchronous read, making it synchronous would allow you to take advantage of available block RAM resources, for optimized device usage and improved timings. Please refer to your documentation for coding guidelines.</td><td>New</td></tr>
<tr><td>INFO&nbsp;</td><td>Xst:2169 - HDL ADVISOR - Some clock signals were not automatically buffered by XST with BUFG/BUFR resources. Please use the buffer_type constraint in order to insert these buffers to the clock signals to help prevent skew problems.</td><td>New</td></tr></tab
